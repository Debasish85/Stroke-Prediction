## Can we Predict Stroke?- A machine learning approach for Stroke Prediction

## Problem Statement: Aim of this  project is to predict the certainty of a person to have this deadly disease based on various parameters such as age, gender, healthy habits, etc. so that this disease can be predicted before it becomes critical and be treated with normal measures and no lives are lost. From the vast pool of machine learning algorithms, we chose few methods to predict accurately.

## Methods:
-K- Nearest Neighbor (K-NN)
-Support Vector Machine (SVM)
-Logistic Regression
-Decision Tree
-Random Forest
-Gaussian NB
-Bernoulli NB
