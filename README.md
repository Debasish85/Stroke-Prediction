## Can we Predict Stroke?- A machine learning approach for Stroke Prediction

## Problem Statement: 
Aim of this  project is to predict the certainty of a person to have this deadly disease based on various parameters such as age, gender, healthy habits, etc. so that this disease can be predicted before it becomes critical and be treated with normal measures and no lives are lost. From the vast pool of machine learning algorithms, we chose few methods to predict accurately.

## Methods:

Initially, exploratory data analysis was performed to understand the data better and compute some major descriptive statistics. I produced some illustrative visualizations representing the dataset as well. Then, various machine learning algorithms were employed to see the best- resulting model for the prediction model. Mainly, SVM, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and KNN are the potential algorithms used.
List of Algorithms used:
 - K- Nearest Neighbor (K-NN)
 - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
 - Logistic Regression
 - Decision Tree
 - Random Forest
 - Gaussian NB
 - Bernoulli NB
